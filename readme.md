# this is my NIU configuration

In order to keep track of my keyboard bindings in my ortho niu mini
keyboard, im maintaining my config file in here.

The website to build the firmware is https://kbfirmware.com/

The json file is the configuration to my keyboard

I built the pcb and wired it after I got the package from china after a few
weeks. [kbdfans.com](https://kbdfans.com/collections/diy-kit/products/niu-mini-40-diy-kit?variant=40822907789)

Getting used to it, the new layout and all that is quite a challenge, but
nothing comes for free.
